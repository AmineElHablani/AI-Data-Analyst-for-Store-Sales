# AI-Data-Analyst-for-Store-Sales

## Overview
This project features an "AI Data Analyst" designed specifically for a store's sales data. The AI Data Analyst is a chatbot that provides employees (business owners or store managers) with valuable analytical insights about the store. Trained on manually curated data created from a detailed analysis of the store's sales data, this chatbot can assist in understanding various aspects of the business and make predictions using a time series forecasting model.


## Features
- **Chatbot Integration**: The AI Data Analyst chatbot is trained on data manually created after analyzing the store's sales data. This allows it to deliver precise and relevant analytical information, answering queries about the store's performance based on insights derived from the sales data.
Prediction Capabilities: The chatbot can make predictions about future sales using a time series forecasting model developed in a separate project.
Interactive Web Interface: The project includes a user-friendly website built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an accessible interface for interacting with the AI Data Analyst.
Technologies Used

• **Python**: Utilized for natural language processing (NLP) to create the chatbot and for developing the time series forecasting model.

• **Flask**: Used as the web framework for building the server-side application.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Employed for designing and developing the client-side interface of the website.

## Inspiration
Inspired by "Devin AI," the first AI software engineer, this project aims to offer business owners a personalized AI data analyst to simplify data analysis and provide quick, actionable insights.

## Future Plans
Enhance the chatbot to generate advanced data visualizations.
Implement automatic data generation and real-time insights from store data.
